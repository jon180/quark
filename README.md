# Overview
The goals of this project are to:
1. Combine elements that I like from other programming languages into a new language.
1. Create an interpreter so I can begin using this new language.

This led me to creating a language I call Quark, named after the physics particle. Quark is largely based on the
syntax of Smalltalk: using unary, binary, and keyword messages.

# Directories
* src/quark: main source code
  * src/quark/component: main components of the interpreter: lexer, parser, and executor
* samples: sample files used for testing the interpreter
* lang: basic library of classes to be provided with the language
